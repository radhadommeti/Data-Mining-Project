Rain Fall Detection is mainly concerned for predicting the rainfall using two algorithms(Data Mining Techniques). It provides critical information about future weather.Our application is about finding the accuracy for a data set by using two different data mining techniques.This respective data set is used for predicting rainfall by using its attributes such as Temperature, Humidity, Wind direction, Wind speed, Moisture etc. Naive Bayes, the classification algorithm used for predicting rainfall in probabilistic way which is simple and powerful. Another Data Mining technique is SVM(Support Vector Machine) ,supervised machine learning algorithm is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane.
